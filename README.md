# **Particle Life Simulator**

**About the Project**

This project implements a dynamic particle system where thousands of particles interact based on predefined rules, creating complex emergent patterns and visual complexity. Inspired by biological systems, the simulation showcases how simple interaction rules can lead to fascinating collective behaviors.
